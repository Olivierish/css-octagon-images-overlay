                        <p>
                            Cheetahs are the fastest land animals. 
                            They were once found in India, but now the Asiatic 
                            species of the cheetah are extinct.
                            The Cheetah has solid spots which mostly 
                            round and about 2-3cm. As they are adapted to run fast, 
                            they have a streamlined body with a small face. 
                            Their preferred habitats include semi-desert regions, 
                            savannahs, grasslands, and thick bush.

                        <h2>The Leopard</h2>
                        <p>
                            Leopards look similar to Jaguars and cheetahs but are smaller in size to them. They have spots that are inside polygonal rosettes. They are smaller than the spots seen on jaguars.
                            They can run at speeds of 60 kmph. They are mostly nocturnal and prefer to hunt alone at night. They grab the throat of their prey and kill it with a quick and powerful bite. 
                            Each leopard kills about 20 animals per year.
                            They are very good tree climbers and often take their prey onto trees to protect it from lions and hyenas.

                        <p>
                            Each spot on a jaguar looks part of a rose and are called rosettes. The third-largest big cat after the lion and tiger is the Jaguar. Jaguars have the strongest bites. Jaguars can run up to 80 kmph. They can hunt anything from frogs and fishes to cows and deer. They are found in central and south America. Jaguars can climb trees but they do not prefer doing so as they are not as agile as leopards.
                            Jaguars too are solitary animals. They are good at climbing trees and often stalk and pounce upon their prey from trees.

                            Panthers are not a separate species. Any dark-colored jaguar or leopard is called a panther.
